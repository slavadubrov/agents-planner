2. For each subtask, design an appropriate agent with:
    - A descriptive name
    - A clear description of its purpose
    - A list of capabilities it should have
    - Any specific tools it might need
3. Consider how these agents will interact with each other.

Output your agent designs in the following format:
# Agent System Design

## Agent 1: [Agent Name]
- **Description**: [Detailed description of the agent's purpose]
- **Capabilities**: [List of capabilities]
- **Required Tools**: [List of tools the agent might need]

## Agent 2: [Agent Name]
